## Revision History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 2.3 | 2026-10-07 | Documented the session coordinator runtime: the session monitor hosts the coordinator, always maintains assignment leases, applies persisted toggles live, yields to foreground coordinators, and `conflict_notify` is now opt-in |
| 2.2 | 2026-08-17 | Reality sweep: corrected every stale API example to shipped syntax (activity/wait/route/send/diff/CASS/spawn), fixed `[alerts]`/`[cass]` config keys and the session-health JSON shape to match the code, added per-section status markers, and put the file under the G3 docs-conformance gate with zero skip waivers |
| 2.1 | 2026-07-18 | Documented atomic assignment, fail-closed operator-label enrichment, persistent coordinator toggles, and the canonical resilience configuration |
| 2.0 | 2025-12-30 | Major revision: Added state transition hysteresis, enhanced wait command with error handling, Agent Mail integration for alerts, configurable scoring weights, sticky routing, parallel step execution, conditional logic, loop constructs, output parsing, pipeline notifications |
| 1.0 | 2025-12-30 | Initial design document |

## Key Improvements in v2.0

### Activity Detection
- **State Transition Hysteresis**: Prevents rapid state flapping by requiring 2s stability before transition (except ERROR which transitions immediately)
- **Unicode & ANSI Handling**: Proper character counting with escape sequence stripping
- **Enhanced Wait Command**: Error handling with `--exit-on-error`, composed conditions, partial wait support

### Health & Resilience
- **Soft vs Hard Restart**: Tries soft restart (Ctrl+C) before hard restart (kill + relaunch)
- **Agent Mail Integration**: Health alerts sent via Agent Mail for multi-agent awareness
- **Context Loss Notification**: Notifies when hard restart causes context loss

### Smart Routing
- **Configurable Scoring Weights**: Users can tune the 40%/40%/20% balance via config
- **Sticky Routing Strategy**: Prefers same agent for related tasks (context affinity)
- **Agent Mail Reservation Integration**: File reservations boost agent scores

### Output Synthesis
- **Structured Extraction**: Parse code blocks, JSON, file paths from agent output
- **Activity Summary Generation**: Per-agent reports of what was accomplished

### CASS Injection
- **Topic Filtering**: Exclude irrelevant historical context by category
- **Smart Placement**: Context injection format varies by agent type

### Workflow Pipelines (Major Enhancements)
- **Parallel Step Execution**: Run multiple steps concurrently on different agents
- **Conditional Logic**: `when:` clauses with full expression evaluation
- **Loop Constructs**: for-each, while, and times loops with break/continue
- **Output Parsing**: Extract JSON fields, regex captures from step outputs
- **Pipeline Notifications**: Desktop, webhook, and Agent Mail on completion/failure

## Executive Summary

NTM currently excels at **infrastructure** (spawning agents, sending prompts, capturing output)
but lacks **intelligence** (understanding what agents are doing, routing work smartly,
synthesizing results). This document describes six foundational features that transform
NTM from a session manager into an intelligent multi-agent orchestration platform.

## Feature 1: Agent Activity Detection

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm activity`, `ntm wait`, `--robot-activity`, and `--robot-wait` are live.

### Problem Statement

NTM is currently "blind" after sending a prompt. It cannot answer:
- Is the agent actively generating output?
- Is the agent waiting for input?
- Has the agent encountered an error?
- Is the agent stalled or crashed?

This blindness prevents intelligent orchestration, automated workflows, and reliable scripting.

### Solution Overview

Implement real-time activity state detection by analyzing pane output characteristics.

### Core Concepts

**1. Output Velocity**
Track characters per second being written to each pane. This is the primary activity signal.

```
High velocity (>10 c/s)  → Agent is generating
Zero velocity            → Agent may be idle OR stalled (need other signals)
Burst patterns           → Typical of AI token streaming
```

**2. Pattern Library**
Agent-specific regex patterns that identify states:

| Pattern Type | Claude Examples | Codex Examples | Antigravity Examples | Gemini Examples (legacy) |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Idle Prompt | `claude>`, `Claude Code>` | `$`, `codex>` | `agy>`, `>>>` | `gemini>`, `>>>` |
| Error | `rate limit`, `error:` | `Error:`, `429` | `Error`, `quota` | `Error`, `quota` |
| Thinking | `...`, `Thinking` | `...` | `Thinking...` | `Thinking...` |
| Completion | `Done`, `✓` | `Complete` | `Finished` | `Finished` |

**3. State Classification**
Combine velocity + patterns into confidence-weighted states:

```go
type AgentState string

const (
    StateGenerating AgentState = "GENERATING"  // High velocity, active output
    StateWaiting    AgentState = "WAITING"     // Idle prompt, ready for input
    StateThinking   AgentState = "THINKING"    // Low velocity, processing
    StateError      AgentState = "ERROR"       // Error pattern detected
    StateStalled    AgentState = "STALLED"     // No activity when expected
    StateUnknown    AgentState = "UNKNOWN"     // Insufficient signals
)
```

**4. Classification Algorithm**

```
INPUT: velocity (chars/sec), last_output_age, patterns_detected, expected_state

IF error_pattern IN patterns_detected:
    RETURN ERROR, confidence=0.95

IF idle_prompt IN patterns_detected:
    IF velocity < 1:
        RETURN WAITING, confidence=0.90
    ELSE:
        RETURN GENERATING, confidence=0.70  # Outputting but has prompt visible

IF thinking_pattern IN patterns_detected:
    RETURN THINKING, confidence=0.80

IF velocity > 10:
    RETURN GENERATING, confidence=0.85

IF velocity == 0 AND last_output_age > stall_threshold:
    IF expected_state == GENERATING:
        RETURN STALLED, confidence=0.75
    ELSE:
        RETURN WAITING, confidence=0.60  # Might just be idle

RETURN UNKNOWN, confidence=0.50
```

### API Design

**Robot Mode:**
```bash
ntm --robot-activity=myproject
ntm --robot-activity=myproject --activity-type=claude
```

There is no pane filter for `--robot-activity`; it reports every agent pane in
the session (`--activity-type` narrows by agent type).

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "session": "myproject",
  "agents": [
    {
      "pane": "1",
      "pane_idx": 1,
      "agent_type": "claude",
      "state": "GENERATING",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "velocity": 45.2,
      "state_since": "2025-01-15T10:29:30Z",
      "pane_pid": 12345,

      "observation_confidence": 0.9,
      "safe_to_dispatch": false,
      "output_sequence": {"epoch": "ea378164557d3868", "sequence": 42}
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_agents": 1,
    "by_state": {"GENERATING": 1}
  },
  "_agent_hints": {
    "available_agents": ["myproject__cc_2", "myproject__cod_1"],
    "busy_agents": ["myproject__cc_1"],
    "suggestions": ["2 agents ready for new work"]
  }
}
```

**Human CLI:**
```
$ ntm activity myproject

Session: myproject                                    10:30:00
┌───────────────────┬──────────────┬───────────┬────────────┐
│ Pane              │ State        │ Velocity  │ Duration   │
├───────────────────┼──────────────┼───────────┼────────────┤
│ myproject__cc_1   │ ● GENERATING │ 45 c/s    │ 30s        │
│ myproject__cc_2   │ ○ WAITING    │ 0 c/s     │ 2m 15s     │
│ myproject__cod_1  │ ○ WAITING    │ 0 c/s     │ 5m 30s     │
│ myproject__gmi_1  │ ✗ ERROR      │ 0 c/s     │ 12m        │
└───────────────────┴──────────────┴───────────┴────────────┘
Summary: 1 generating, 2 waiting, 1 error
```

**Wait Command:**
```bash
# Wait for all agents to be idle
ntm wait myproject --until=idle --timeout=5m

# Wait for any agent to become available
ntm wait myproject --until=idle --any --timeout=2m

# Wait for specific pane
ntm wait myproject --pane=1 --until=idle --timeout=3m

# Robot mode
ntm --robot-wait=myproject --wait-until=idle --timeout=5m
```

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Efficiency**: Don't capture full pane output too frequently. Sample at 500ms-1s intervals.

2. **Accuracy vs Speed**: More frequent sampling = more accurate velocity, but more overhead.

3. **Agent-Specific Patterns**: Pattern library should be easily extensible for new agents.

4. **Tmux Integration**: Use `tmux capture-pane` for output, `tmux list-panes` for metadata.

5. **State Persistence**: Track state history for debugging and analytics.

### Why This is Foundational

Activity detection enables:
- **Smart Routing** (Feature 3): Route to agents that are WAITING
- **Health Monitoring** (Feature 2): Detect STALLED and ERROR states
- **Workflow Pipelines** (Feature 6): Wait for step completion
- **Dashboard Enhancement**: Show real-time agent status

---

## Feature 2: Agent Health & Resilience

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm health`, `--robot-health[=SESSION]`, `[resilience]` auto-restart, and rate-limit backoff are live.

### Problem Statement

Agents can fail in many ways:
- Process crashes (agent CLI exits)
- Rate limiting (API throttles requests)
- Network errors (connectivity issues)
- Context overflow (agent refuses input)
- Silent hangs (no output, no error)

Currently, users don't know about failures until they manually check. No automatic recovery exists.

### Solution Overview

Continuous health monitoring with automatic recovery and alerting.

### Health States

```
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ State        │ Meaning                                                │
├──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ healthy      │ All checks pass, functioning normally                  │
│ degraded     │ Recent issues (errors, restarts) but currently working │
│ unhealthy    │ Critical failure, needs intervention or restart        │
│ rate_limited │ API rate limit detected, in backoff period             │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Health Check Components

**1. Process Check**
Is the agent process still running?
- Check for shell prompt in pane (agent crashed back to shell)
- Look for exit codes or "exited" messages

**2. Stall Detection**
Is the agent hung?
- Uses Activity Detection (Feature 1)
- No output when activity expected
- Not in WAITING state but no progress

**3. Error Detection**
Has the agent hit an error?
- Rate limit patterns: `rate limit`, `429`, `quota exceeded`
- Error patterns: `error:`, `exception`, `failed`
- Crash patterns: `panic`, `segfault`, `killed`

**4. Rate Limit Tracking**
Track rate limit events for backoff:
- Count rate limits in sliding window
- Calculate appropriate backoff delay
- Prevent sending during backoff

### Automatic Recovery

**Restart Logic:**
```
ON agent_health == unhealthy:
    IF restarts_this_hour < max_restarts:
        backoff_delay = min(base * 2^restarts, max_backoff)
        WAIT backoff_delay

        SEND Ctrl+C to pane
        WAIT for shell prompt
        SEND agent launch command (cc, cod, agy, gmi)

        restarts_this_hour++
        UPDATE health state
    ELSE:
        ALERT "Max restarts exceeded, manual intervention needed"
```

**Rate Limit Backoff:**
```
ON rate_limit_detected:
    SET agent_state = rate_limited
    backoff = 30s * 2^(consecutive_rate_limits - 1)
    backoff = min(backoff, 5m)  # Cap at 5 minutes

    BLOCK sends to this agent for backoff duration
    AFTER backoff: CLEAR rate_limited state
```

### Configuration

Health monitoring and auto-restart are configured through `[resilience]`
(there is no separate `[health]` section — the restart engine reads
`[resilience]` plus the spawn-time `--auto-restart` flag). Configuration is
strict, so an old `[health]` table now fails loading and must be migrated. This
does not remove the separate `ntm health` command:

```toml
[resilience]
auto_restart = true          # Enable automatic agent restart on crash
max_restarts = 3             # Max restarts per agent before giving up
restart_delay_seconds = 30   # Seconds to wait before restarting
health_check_seconds = 10    # Seconds between health checks
crash_threshold = 3          # Consecutive failures before restart

[resilience.rate_limit]
detect = true                # Detect rate limits
notify = true                # Send notification on rate limit

[alerts]
enabled = true                    # Top-level toggle for the alert system
agent_stuck_minutes = 5           # Minutes without output before alerting
disk_low_threshold_gb = 5.0       # Minimum free disk space (GB)
mail_backlog_threshold = 10       # Unread messages before alerting
bead_stale_hours = 24             # Hours before an in-progress bead is stale
context_warning_threshold = 75.0  # Context usage % that triggers a warning
resolved_prune_minutes = 60       # How long to keep resolved alerts
```

Crash/restart/rate-limit notifications are controlled by `[resilience]`
(`notify_on_crash`, `notify_on_max_restarts`, `[resilience.rate_limit] notify`),
not by `[alerts]`.

### API Design

**Robot Mode:**
```bash
ntm --robot-health=SESSION
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "session": "myproject",
  "checked_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "agents": [
    {
      "pane": 1,
      "pane_target": "%1",
      "agent_type": "claude",
      "health": "healthy",
      "idle_since_seconds": 12,
      "restarts": 0,
      "rate_limit_count": 0,
      "backoff_remaining": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9
    },
    {
      "pane": 2,
      "pane_target": "%2",
      "agent_type": "codex",
      "health": "degraded",
      "idle_since_seconds": 340,
      "restarts": 2,
      "last_error": "rate limit exceeded, retrying in 60s",
      "rate_limit_count": 3,
      "backoff_remaining": 45,
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 2,
    "healthy": 1,
    "degraded": 1,
    "unhealthy": 0,
    "rate_limited": 0,
    "blocked": 0
  }
}
```

(`health` is one of `healthy`, `degraded`, `unhealthy`, `rate_limited`;
`blocked` counts panes parked on an interactive gate screen awaiting a human
keystroke.)

**Human CLI:**
```
$ ntm health myproject

Session: myproject                Health Report
┌───────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────────┬─────────────┐
│ Pane              │ Health   │ Uptime  │ Restarts │ Last Error  │
├───────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────────┼─────────────┤
│ myproject__cc_1   │ ● healthy│ 2h 15m  │ 0        │ -           │
│ myproject__cod_1  │ ◐ degraded│ 45m    │ 2        │ rate_limit  │
└───────────────────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────────┴─────────────┘

$ ntm health myproject --verbose
# Shows full error details, backoff timers, etc.
```

### Implementation Notes

1. **On-Demand vs Continuous**: Start with on-demand health checks. Background monitoring can be added later.

2. **Restart Command Detection**: Need to detect the correct agent launch command per pane type.

3. **Context Loss**: Restarting an agent loses its context. This is unavoidable but should be logged.

4. **Alert Fatigue**: Debounce alerts to avoid spamming on flapping agents.

---

## Feature 3: Smart Work Distribution

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm send --smart/--route`, `--robot-route`, and `--robot-assign` are live. Shipped strategies go beyond this design: least-loaded, first-available, round-robin, round-robin-available, random, sticky, explicit, affinity.

### Problem Statement

With multiple agents, users manually decide which one to send work to. This leads to:
- Sending to already-busy agents (delays)
- Sending to nearly-full context agents (quality issues)
- Uneven load distribution

### Solution Overview

Intelligent routing based on agent state and context usage.

### Scoring System

Each agent gets a score (0-100) based on multiple factors:

```
Score = (context_score × 0.4) + (state_score × 0.4) + (recency_score × 0.2)

where:
  context_score = 100 - context_usage_percent
  state_score = {WAITING: 100, THINKING: 50, GENERATING: 0, ERROR: -100}
  recency_score = based on time since last activity
```

**Example Scoring:**

| Agent | Context | State | Recency | Score | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------|----------------|
| cc_1 | 72% | GENERATING | 5s | 11.2 + 0 + 15 = 26 | Skip (busy) |
| cc_2 | 28% | WAITING | 2m | 28.8 + 40 + 8 = 77 | Good choice |
| cc_3 | 45% | WAITING | 5m | 22 + 40 + 5 = 67 | Acceptable |

### Routing Strategies

**1. least-loaded (default)**
Pick agent with highest score. Best for load balancing.

**2. first-available**
Pick first agent in WAITING state. Fastest, no scoring overhead.

**3. round-robin**
Rotate through agents regardless of state. Predictable distribution.

**4. random**
Random selection among available agents. Simple load distribution.

**5. affinity**
Pick the agent holding live Agent Mail file reservations on the files the
prompt names (the highest fraction of named files covered; score breaks
ties). Falls back to least-loaded — reported as `fallback_used` — when no
available agent holds any. Needs `[agent_mail] enabled = true` and the
session's agent registry (written when ntm registers panes with Agent Mail).
Choosing this strategy is its own opt-in; `[routing] affinity_enabled`
separately adds the same signal as a score bonus under every strategy.

### API Design

**Get Routing Recommendation:**
```bash
ntm --robot-route=myproject --type=claude --strategy=least-loaded
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session": "myproject",
  "strategy": "least-loaded",
  "recommendation": {
    "pane_id": "%12",
    "pane_index": 2,
    "agent_type": "claude",
    "score": 77,
    "reason": "highest_score_available",
    "context_usage": 28,
    "state": "WAITING"
  },
  "candidates": [
    {"pane_id": "%11", "pane_index": 1, "agent_type": "claude", "score": 26, "context_usage": 72, "state": "GENERATING"},
    {"pane_id": "%12", "pane_index": 2, "agent_type": "claude", "score": 77, "context_usage": 28, "state": "WAITING"},
    {"pane_id": "%13", "pane_index": 3, "agent_type": "claude", "score": 67, "context_usage": 45, "state": "WAITING"}
  ]
}
```

**Smart Send:**
```bash
# Old way: broadcast to all Claude agents
ntm send myproject --cc "Fix the bug"

# New way: send to best available Claude agent
ntm send myproject --cc --smart "Fix the bug"

# Or with explicit strategy (--route implies --smart)
ntm send myproject --cc --route=least-loaded "Fix the bug"

# Prefer the agent already holding the files the prompt names
ntm send myproject --route=affinity "Fix internal/auth/session.go"
```

An explicit `--pane`/`--panes` wins over routing. `--all`, `--skip-first`,
`--project`, `--batch`, and `--distribute` are rejected alongside
`--smart`/`--route`: each would otherwise silently ignore or contradict the
single-agent routing decision.

**Robot Mode Send with Routing:**

`--robot-send` does not route by itself; robot callers compose routing from the
two shipped primitives — query `--robot-route` for a recommendation, then send
to the recommended pane:

```bash
ntm --robot-route=myproject --type=claude --strategy=least-loaded
ntm --robot-send=myproject --msg="Fix bug" --pane=%12

# Affinity ranks by the files the message names, so pass the message
ntm --robot-route=myproject --strategy=affinity --msg="Fix internal/auth/session.go"
```

`--robot-send` rejects the route-only modifiers (`--strategy`, `--last-agent`,
`--route-*`) with `INVALID_FLAG` instead of ignoring them and delivering to
every matching pane.

(Human CLI callers get the same composition in one step via
`ntm send --smart`.)

### Integration with Health

Skip unhealthy and rate-limited agents (hard exclusions, not score penalties):
- `health == unhealthy` → excluded when `exclude_if_error_state` is on (default: true)
- `rate_limited` → excluded when `exclude_if_rate_limited` is on (default: true); there is no "unless only option" fallback

(Implemented in `AgentScorer.checkExclusion`, internal/robot/routing.go.)

---

## Feature 4: Output Synthesis

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm conflicts`, `ntm diff`, `ntm changes`, and `--robot-diff` are live.

### Problem Statement

When multiple agents work in parallel:
- They may modify the same files (conflict)
- Their approaches may differ (need comparison)
- Summarizing activity is manual

### Solution Overview

Tools for detecting conflicts, comparing outputs, and summarizing activity.

### Scope (Phase 1)

1. **File Conflict Detection**: Use git to detect overlapping modifications
2. **Output Comparison**: Side-by-side or unified diff of agent outputs
3. **Activity Summary**: What did each agent do recently?

Note: AI-powered synthesis is out of scope for Phase 1.

### File Conflict Detection

Approach using git:
```bash
# 1. Get current git status
git status --porcelain

# 2. Track which files were modified during session
# 3. If same file modified by multiple agents → potential conflict
```

Challenges:
- Git doesn't know which agent modified which file
- Heuristic: Track file modification times vs. agent activity times
- Best effort: Flag files modified during multi-agent activity

### API Design

**Robot Mode:**
```bash
ntm --robot-diff=SESSION --since=10m
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timeframe": {
    "since": "2025-01-15T10:20:00Z",
    "until": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "files": {
    "modified": ["src/auth.go", "src/user.go", "tests/auth_test.go"],
    "potential_conflicts": [
      {
        "file": "src/auth.go",
        "likely_modifiers": ["myproject__cc_1", "myproject__cc_2"],
        "git_status": "modified",
        "reason": "Both agents active during file modification window"
      }
    ],
    "clean": ["src/user.go", "tests/auth_test.go"]
  },
  "agent_activity": [
    {"pane": "myproject__cc_1", "output_lines": 245, "active_time_s": 180},
    {"pane": "myproject__cc_2", "output_lines": 189, "active_time_s": 150}
  ]
}
```

## Feature 5: CASS Auto-Injection

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm send --with-cass/--no-cass`, `--robot-send --with-cass/--no-cass`, `ntm cass preview`, and the `[cass.context]` config are live. Assignment prompts are enriched through the same pipeline: `ntm assign` (and `ntm coordinator assign`) and `--robot-bulk-assign` take `--with-cass/--no-cass/--with-memory`, and the coordinator's auto-assign follows `[cass.context] enabled` and `[memory] send_injection` (see [Assignment-time injection](#assignment-time-injection)).

### Problem Statement

CASS contains valuable historical context from past sessions. Currently:
1. Users must remember to query CASS
2. Users must manually copy/paste relevant findings
3. Context is often forgotten or overlooked

### Solution Overview

Automatically inject relevant CASS findings before sending prompts.

### How It Works

```
User: ntm send myproject --cc "Implement rate limiting"
         │
         ▼
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ 1. Extract keywords from prompt     │
    │ 2. Query CASS for relevant history  │
    │ 3. Filter by relevance threshold    │
    │ 4. Check agent's context budget     │
    │ 5. Format and prepend to prompt     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
Injected prompt:

    [Context from past sessions]
    - Session abc (0.89 relevance, 2 days ago):
      Implemented token bucket rate limiting using Redis...
    - Session def (0.82 relevance, 5 days ago):
      Per-IP rate limits with sliding window algorithm...

    [Your task]
    Implement rate limiting
```

### Configuration

```toml
[cass]
enabled = true              # Top-level switch for all CASS features
binary_path = ""            # Path to cass binary (auto-detect from PATH if empty)
timeout = 30                # Timeout for CASS operations (seconds)

[cass.context]
enabled = true              # Auto-inject context (send-time default; override per send with --with-cass/--no-cass)
max_sessions = 3            # Max past sessions to include
min_relevance = 0.7         # Minimum similarity score
max_tokens = 500            # Token budget for injection
skip_if_context_above = 60  # Skip if agent > 60% context usage
prefer_same_project = true  # Prefer history from same project
lookback_days = 30          # Only consider recent history
```

### API Integration

```bash
# Enable for this send
ntm send myproject --cc --with-cass "Implement rate limiting"

# Disable for this send (overrides config)
ntm send myproject --cc --no-cass "Simple fix"

# Preview what would be injected
ntm cass preview "Implement rate limiting"
```

**Robot Mode:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "cass_injection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "query": "Implement rate limiting",
    "items_found": 5,
    "items_injected": 2,
    "tokens_added": 380,
    "sources": [
      {"session": "abc", "relevance": 0.89, "age_days": 2},
      {"session": "def", "relevance": 0.82, "age_days": 5}
    ],
    "skipped_reason": null
  },
  ...
}
```

### Assignment-time injection

Every surface that hands an agent its work enriches the assignment prompt
before the agent starts, so each task begins with the lessons from past
sessions that solved similar problems:

| Surface | Control |
|---------|---------|
| `ntm assign` (`--auto`, `--pane`, `--watch`, `--retry`, `--reassign`), `ntm coordinator assign` | `--with-cass` / `--no-cass` / `--with-memory` |
| `ntm --robot-bulk-assign` | `--with-cass` / `--no-cass` / `--with-memory` |
| Session coordinator auto-assign (`ntm coordinator run`, session monitor) | config only |

Precedence matches send: `--no-cass` > `--with-cass` > `[cass] enabled &&
[cass.context] enabled`; `--with-memory` or `[memory] enabled &&
send_injection` turns on CM rules. The CASS query is built from the bead's
title, labels, and description (credentials redacted) rather than the
template boilerplate, and the CM workspace is the bead's project.

The prompt is enriched once, **before** the durable assignment intent is
recorded: the assignment ledger hashes and persists the enriched prompt
(`pending_prompt` / `prompt_sent`), plus `base_intent_sha256`, the checksum of
the prompt before enrichment. Retries and recovery (`ntm assign --retry` of a
pending claim, a same-intent `ntm assign --pane` re-run, a
`--robot-bulk-assign` re-run of the same template intent, and the
coordinator's pending recovery) replay the recorded prompt exactly and never
query cass or cm again. cass or cm being missing, disabled, or failing never
blocks an assignment; each assignment record in the JSON output carries the
same `cass_injection` / `memory_injection` objects as send, including the
skip reason on the degraded path.

## Feature 6: Workflow Pipelines

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm pipeline run/status/list/cancel/resume` and the `--robot-pipeline-*` surfaces are live.

### Problem Statement

Complex tasks require multiple steps, different agents, waiting for completion, and error handling. Currently this requires manual orchestration.

### Solution Overview

Define workflows in YAML/TOML and execute them automatically.

### Workflow Schema (v2.0)

```yaml
schema_version: "2.0"
name: feature-implementation
description: Design → Implement → Test → Review
version: "1.0"

vars:
  feature_name:
    description: "Name of the feature to implement"
    required: true
    type: string
  run_tests:
    default: true
    type: boolean

settings:
  timeout: 30m
  notify_on_complete: true
  notify_on_error: true

steps:
  - id: design
    name: "Design Phase"
    agent: claude
    route: least-loaded
    prompt: |
      Design the architecture for: ${vars.feature_name}
    wait: completion
    timeout: 5m
    output_var: design_doc      # Store output in variable
    output_parse: none          # or json, yaml, lines

  # PARALLEL STEPS - run concurrently
  - id: parallel_impl
    parallel:
      - id: backend
        agent: codex
        prompt: Implement backend for: ${vars.design_doc}
      - id: frontend
        agent: claude
        prompt: Implement frontend for: ${vars.design_doc}

  # CONDITIONAL STEP - skip if condition false
  - id: test
    name: "Testing"
    when: ${vars.run_tests}    # Only run if run_tests is true
    agent: antigravity
    depends_on: [parallel_impl]
    prompt: |
      Test these implementations:
      Backend: ${steps.backend.output}
      Frontend: ${steps.frontend.output}
    on_error: retry
    retry_count: 2

  - id: review
    depends_on: [parallel_impl, test]
    prompt: Review all changes
```

### Parallel Steps

Run multiple steps concurrently on different agents:

```yaml
- id: research_phase
  parallel:
    - id: market_research
      agent: claude
      prompt: Research market trends
    - id: tech_research
      agent: codex
      prompt: Research technical options
    - id: competitor_analysis
      agent: antigravity
      prompt: Analyze competitors
  # All three run simultaneously, next step waits for all

- id: synthesis
  depends_on: [research_phase]
  prompt: |
    Synthesize findings:
    ${steps.market_research.output}
    ${steps.tech_research.output}
    ${steps.competitor_analysis.output}
```

### Conditional Execution

Skip steps based on conditions:

```yaml
- id: check_env
  prompt: Return the environment name
  output_var: env
  output_parse: first_line

- id: prod_deploy
  when: ${vars.env} == "production"
  prompt: Deploy to production with full validation

- id: staging_deploy
  when: ${vars.env} != "production"
  prompt: Quick deploy to staging
```

Supported operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `contains`

### Loop Constructs

Iterate over collections:

```yaml
# For-each loop
- id: process_files
  loop:
    items: ${vars.files}
    as: file
  steps:
    - id: process
      prompt: Process ${loop.file}

# Access loop variables: ${loop.file}, ${loop.index}, ${loop.count}

# While loop
- id: poll
  loop:
    while: ${vars.status} != "ready"
    max_iterations: 10
    delay: 30s
  steps:
    - id: check
      prompt: Check status
      output_var: status
```

### Output Parsing

Extract structured data from step outputs:

```yaml
- id: get_config
  prompt: Return config as JSON
  output_var: config
  output_parse: json           # Parse as JSON

- id: use_config
  prompt: Use port ${vars.config.port}  # Access JSON fields!

# Parsing modes: none, json, yaml, lines, first_line, regex
```

### Execution Model

```
1. Load and validate workflow
2. Resolve dependencies (topological sort)
3. For each step in order:
   a. Wait for dependencies to complete
   b. Resolve variables (${vars.X}, ${steps.Y.output})
   c. Select agent (routing strategy)
   d. Send prompt
   e. Wait for completion (using Feature 1)
   f. Capture output
   g. Update state
   h. Handle errors per step config
4. Complete workflow
```

### Variable Substitution

| Variable | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `${vars.X}` | `${vars.feature_name}` | Runtime variable |
| `${steps.X.output}` | `${steps.design.output}` | Previous step output |
| `${steps.X.pane}` | `${steps.design.pane}` | Pane used for step |
| `${env.X}` | `${env.HOME}` | Environment variable |
| `${session}` | `myproject` | Session name |

Environment variables expose the runner's process environment to the workflow.
Missing values fail substitution unless the expression includes a default such as
`${env.OPTIONAL_TOKEN | ""}`.

### Error Handling

Per-step configuration:
- `on_error: fail` - Stop pipeline immediately (default)
- `on_error: continue` - Log error, continue to next step
- `on_error: retry` - Retry step N times with delay

### State Persistence

Pipeline state saved to `.ntm/pipelines/<run-id>.json`:
- Survives NTM restarts
- Enables resume after failure
- Provides audit trail

### API Design

```bash
# Run workflow
ntm pipeline run workflow.yaml --var feature_name="user auth"

# Check status
ntm pipeline status run-abc123

# List pipelines
ntm pipeline list

# Cancel
ntm pipeline cancel run-abc123

# Resume failed pipeline
ntm pipeline resume run-abc123
```

**Robot Mode:**
```bash
ntm --robot-pipeline-run=workflow.yaml --pipeline-vars='{"feature_name":"auth"}'
ntm --robot-pipeline=run-abc123
ntm --robot-pipeline-list
ntm --robot-pipeline-cancel=run-abc123
```

```json
{
  "id": "run-abc123",
  "workflow": "feature-implementation",
  "status": "running",
  "started_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "current_step": "implement",
  "progress": {
    "completed": 1,
    "running": 1,
    "pending": 2,

## Feature 7: Thundering Herd Prevention

**Status: Shipped** — `ntm spawn --stagger/--stagger-mode/--stagger-delay`, `ntm spawn --assign`, the `NTM_SPAWN_*` env vars (`ntm spawn`), `--robot-spawn --spawn-assign-work`, `--robot-spawn --spawn-prompt/--spawn-prompt-file`, `--robot-spawn --spawn-stagger-mode/--spawn-stagger-delay`, and the `[spawn]` config table (`stagger_mode`, `stagger_delay`) are shipped. Both surfaces resolve stagger through one planner (`robot.ResolveSpawnStagger`).

### Problem Statement

When multiple agents spawn simultaneously and self-select work via `bv --robot-triage` or `br ready`, they race to claim the same beads:

```
T=0:    Agent1, Agent2, Agent3 all spawn
T=30s:  All finish reading codebase
T=35s:  All run `bv --robot-triage`
T=36s:  All see "ntm-g2lq" as top recommendation
T=37s:  All start working on ntm-g2lq
Result: Duplicate work, file conflicts, wasted tokens
```

The race window between `br ready` (read) and a separate status update has no atomicity.

### Solution: Staggered Spawn

Introduce configurable delay between agents starting their work selection:

```bash
# Spawn 3 agents with 90s stagger between prompts
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --stagger

# Custom stagger duration
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --stagger=2m
```

Timing:
```
Agent 1: Receives prompt immediately (T+0)
Agent 2: Receives prompt at T+90s
Agent 3: Receives prompt at T+180s
```

This gives each agent time to:
1. Complete initial codebase analysis
2. Query available work
3. Select and claim a bead (mark in_progress)
4. Begin visible generation

By the time Agent 2 starts selecting, Agent 1 has already claimed its work.

### Why 90 Seconds Default?

Typical agent startup sequence:
- 10-20s: Read AGENTS.md, understand project
- 20-40s: Run initial codebase exploration
- 10-20s: Query `bv`/`br` for work recommendations
- 5-10s: Claim bead and begin work

Total: ~60-90s. The 90s default provides margin for variance.

### Spawn Order Awareness

Each agent knows its position in the spawn batch:

```bash
# Environment variables set per agent
NTM_SPAWN_ORDER=2      # This is agent 2
NTM_SPAWN_TOTAL=4      # Of 4 total
NTM_SPAWN_BATCH_ID=spawn-abc123
```

Enables:
- Self-stagger backup (agent can wait extra if needed)
- Work coordination ("I'm agent 2, pick something different")
- Reporting ("Agent 2 completed task X")

### Alternative: Orchestrator Work Assignment

Instead of agents self-selecting, ntm can assign work:

```bash
# ntm picks work and assigns to each agent
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --assign
```

Flow:
1. NTM requires a structurally valid full actionable `bv --robot-plan` and uses scored `bv --robot-triage` only to rank IDs authorized by that plan.
2. Because the plan omits labels and `br ready` omits epics, NTM replaces every candidate's labels with live evidence from both `br ready` and `br list --status open`.
3. NTM rejects dependency-blocked, active, terminal, and operator-gated work. Any plan command, parse, structure, blank-ID, label lookup, or coverage gap stops automated assignment.
4. NTM atomically claims the bead, reserves its file scope, records durable intent, and dispatches to the exact physical pane.
5. A failed step records or rolls back the generation without reporting a successful assignment.

The durable claim precedes prompt delivery, so another process cannot authorize a duplicate assignment from the same stale planning snapshot.

Configured approval vocabularies extend the built-ins and are case-insensitive:

```toml
[assign]
operator_gated_labels = ["security-review", "legal-approval"]
```

Project `.ntm/config.toml` values add to global values and cannot remove a gate.

### Historical Proposal: Soft-Claim Files

Earlier designs proposed a `.ntm/claims/` delay-and-check protocol. NTM does not
implement that protocol; the atomic Beads claim plus durable assignment ledger
is the supported coordination boundary.

### Coordinator Toggle Persistence

Coordinator feature toggles update the selected config file instead of merely
printing suggested TOML:

```bash
ntm coordinator enable auto-assign
ntm coordinator enable digest --interval=30m
ntm coordinator disable conflict-negotiate
```

The writer preserves unrelated keys, comments, file modes, and symlink targets;
serializes concurrent writers; and validates the complete strict NTM schema
before atomic replacement. The coordinator each session monitor hosts (see
below) re-reads the selected config every 15 seconds and applies a toggle
without a restart. A foreground `ntm coordinator run` reads configuration at
startup and must be restarted to apply one.

Persistence supports both a `[coordinator]` table and root dotted assignments
such as `coordinator.auto_assign = false`. It deliberately refuses a
whole-section inline assignment such as
`coordinator = { auto_assign = false }` without mutating the file, because that
form cannot be updated surgically while preserving the operator's source.

### Session Coordinator Runtime

**Status: Shipped** — the session monitor `ntm spawn` starts hosts the
coordinator; `ntm coordinator status` reports it.

Every session monitor runs the session coordinator, so a toggle persisted with
`ntm coordinator enable` acts on spawned sessions without a separate
`ntm coordinator run`:

```bash
ntm coordinator enable auto-assign
ntm coordinator status myproject
ntm coordinator status myproject --json
```

- **Assignment maintenance always runs.** It renews the exact file
  reservations of delivered, still-owned assignments before their one-hour
  leases lapse, and releases an assignment's reservations and Beads claim once
  its bead is closed (or its pane is gone). Reservations taken by a one-shot
  `ntm assign` are therefore kept alive and cleaned up without
  `ntm assign --watch`. With no feature enabled the monitor runs only this
  maintenance, every 30 seconds, and does nothing while the session's
  assignment ledger has no active assignments. Maintenance reads the saved
  coordinator identity; it never registers one, sends mail, or admits work.
- **Every other action is opt-in.** `auto-assign`, `digest`,
  `conflict-notify`, `conflict-negotiate`, `mail-nudge`, the
  `[rotation] usage_percent_threshold` trigger and
  `[integrations.caam] auto_failover` all default off. Enabling any of them
  switches the monitor to the full coordinator loop that
  `ntm coordinator run` runs. `conflict_notify` is off by default because
  notification mails every holder of overlapping reservations in the project,
  including other sessions' agents, at high importance and again for each
  persisting pair after its cooldown. Enabled auto-assignment whose assignment
  safety policy does not load stays disabled, and the status reports why.
- **No double coordination.** A foreground `ntm coordinator run` (including
  `--once`) or an `ntm assign --watch` that maintains reservations claims the
  session: the monitor stops its coordinator within about a second, stays paused
  while any claim is held, and resumes after the last one ends. The claim waits
  at most one minute for the monitor to stop. `coordinator run --json` reports
  `monitor_yielded: true` when it paused the monitor. Ownership uses `flock`
  locks next to the monitor's control files, so a crashed process never wedges
  the other side.
- **Status.** `ntm coordinator status` shows a Runtime section, and its JSON
  carries `runtime`: `host` (`session-monitor` or `none`), `state`
  (`running`, `yielded`, or `not_running`), `mode` (`maintenance` or `full`),
  the enabled `features`, the monitor's `config_path`,
  `last_maintenance_at`, `maintenance_error`, and `error`. Stopping the session
  (`ntm kill`) stops the coordinator before the monitor releases its lease.

Account-rotation monitors (`ntm swarm` CAAM rotation) run only their CAAM
checker and do not host the coordinator.

### API Design

```bash
# Stagger flags
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --stagger            # default 90s
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --stagger=2m         # custom
ntm spawn myproject --cc=5 --stagger-mode=smart # adaptive rate-limit avoidance
ntm spawn myproject --cc=4 --stagger-mode=fixed --stagger-delay=20s

# Assignment mode
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --assign
ntm spawn myproject --cc=3 --assign --strategy=dependency

# Robot mode: initial prompt + the same stagger modes
ntm --robot-spawn=myproject --spawn-cc=3 --spawn-prompt='Read AGENTS.md, then pick ready work' \
    --spawn-stagger-mode=fixed --spawn-stagger-delay=90s
ntm --robot-spawn=myproject --spawn-cc=5 --spawn-prompt-file=boot.md --spawn-stagger-mode=smart
ntm --robot-spawn=myproject --spawn-cc=3 --spawn-assign-work --strategy=diverse \
    --spawn-stagger-mode=fixed --spawn-stagger-delay=30s
```

`--spawn-prompt` (or `--spawn-prompt-file`, `-` for stdin) is delivered to
every spawned agent only after the readiness wait — it implies `--spawn-wait` —
and goes through the same canonical dispatch port as robot send and spawn work
assignment (final-message redaction, per-agent delivery protocol, and a
dispatch-time re-observation that refuses any pane that is not freshly idle;
never raw send-keys). With `--spawn-assign-work` the initial prompt prefixes
each agent's work prompt, so both arrive in one atomic, paced delivery — a
second back-to-back dispatch would be refused by the idle gate once the first
prompt is running. Grok Build panes take spawn prompts like any other agent
(readiness and composer-gated delivery shipped in phase 2, GH#251).

Pacing is identical on both surfaces: the agent at delivery position `i`
(0-based, launch order) receives its prompt `i × interval` after the first.
`fixed` uses `--stagger-delay` / `--spawn-stagger-delay`; `smart` uses the
learned delay of the strictest provider in the batch from the project's
`.ntm/rate_limits.json` (anthropic, then openai, then google, then omp's own
bucket); `none` delivers back to back. `ntm spawn --stagger[=DURATION]`
remains the legacy fixed interval when no mode is chosen. In assignment mode
each agent's whole claim-and-dispatch waits for its slot, so no bead claim is
held across a stagger wait.

`ntm spawn` reports each pane's `prompt_delay_ms` and, when pacing is active,
`stagger: {enabled, mode, interval_ms}`. `--robot-spawn` reports a `stagger`
plan whenever it delivers prompts (including `--dry-run`, which previews the
delays without delivering):

```json
"stagger": {
  "mode": "fixed", "interval_ms": 90000,
  "schedule": [

`prompt_deliveries[]` holds one `--spawn-prompt` outcome per agent; any failed
delivery makes the envelope fail with `PROMPT_SEND_FAILED` while every
launched pane keeps running. In assignment mode the outcome is on
`assignments[]` (`prompt_sent`, `delivered_at`). Smart mode adds `provider`,
and a `warning` when the rate-limit history is unreadable (the provider's
built-in delay is used). An unsupported mode or a delay outside 0–5m fails
with `INVALID_FLAG` before any session is touched.

### Configuration

The `[spawn]` table supplies defaults for both `ntm spawn` and
`--robot-spawn`. A flag always wins; `[spawn]` applies only when the flag is
not given (an explicit `ntm spawn --stagger` also counts as choosing the
mode):

```toml
[spawn]
stagger_mode = "fixed"   # none (default), fixed, or smart
stagger_delay = "90s"    # fixed-mode interval between agents, 0-5m (default 30s)
```

An invalid value is reported against its key (`[spawn] stagger_mode must be
one of none, fixed, or smart`) and by `ntm config validate`. The bare
`--stagger` default stays 90s. Spawn *rate* pacing (concurrent spawn limits per
provider) is configured separately via `[spawn_pacing]`.

## Implementation Order

**Phase 1: Foundation**
1. Activity Detection (enables everything else)
2. Thundering Herd Prevention (immediate value for parallel spawns)
3. Health & Resilience (can start after Activity basics)
4. Smart Routing (can start after Activity basics)

**Phase 2: Power Features**
5. Output Synthesis (mostly independent)
6. CASS Injection (mostly independent)
7. Workflow Pipelines (needs Activity + Routing)

---

## Success Criteria

Each feature should meet these criteria before considered complete:

1. **Robot API**: Full JSON API with consistent structure
2. **Human CLI**: User-friendly commands with good UX
3. **Tests**: Unit tests + integration tests
4. **Documentation**: Updated README, inline help
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Shows relevant info in dashboard (where applicable)
6. **Configuration**: Sensible defaults, configurable behavior

*This document will be updated as implementation proceeds.*
