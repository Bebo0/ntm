// Package robot: operation_idempotency.go implements the durable idempotent
// operation protocol shared by every retry-safe robot actuation: --robot-send
// (#245) and --robot-interrupt with --op-id, plus their REST Idempotency-Key
// equivalents.
//
// A caller may supply an operation ID. The operation is claimed atomically
// in the runtime projection store BEFORE the actuation mutates any pane and
// is durably bound to the actuation kind plus a kind-specific digest of the
// caller's command spec (sendOperationBindingHash,
// interruptOperationBindingHash).
//
//   - An identical retry of a completed operation returns the original
//     recorded outcome without touching any pane again.
//   - Reusing an operation ID with a different command spec — or for a
//     different actuation kind — is rejected as IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT.
//     Operation IDs form one namespace per session across kinds.
//   - A retry that races a live concurrent claimant observes the operation
//     in progress (OPERATION_IN_PROGRESS) and is told to reconcile via
//     --robot-send-receipt; a claim abandoned by a crashed process is taken
//     over after a staleness window only if it never crossed the durable
//     dispatch boundary. Once input may have been delivered, an unknown
//     outcome requires reconciliation, never implicit redelivery.
//   - An actuation that terminates before mutating anything releases its
//     claim so the ID stays retryable; once a mutation was attempted, the
//     outcome is recorded as terminal.
//
// Receipts expose only a payload digest and byte count — never the payload
// bytes — so ordinary logs gain an audit trail without retaining message
// contents.
