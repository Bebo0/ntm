# deadcode_gate.sh — WS0-G1 dead-code gate (bd-ws0-guards-klz98.2).
#
# "Impressive but unreachable" is a build failure: any function under
# internal/ with no call path from ./cmd/ntm, and any internal/ package not in
# cmd/ntm's import graph, must carry a `ci/allowlists/deadcode.txt` line tied
# to an OPEN bead (both-direction ratchet via scripts/guards/lib/ratchet.sh).
#
# Analysis (needs the Go toolchain):
#   - golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode, version PINNED by the `tool` directive
#     in go.mod (an @latest tool is itself drift), built for the HOST and run
#     once per target GOOS. Roots = ./cmd/ntm, WITHOUT -test: test binaries as
#     roots would mark every tested-but-orphaned engine live — the exact
#     pathology this gate exists to catch (bead review round 3).
#   - Multi-config: deadcode is valid for one GOOS/GOARCH at a time. We run
#     GOOS=linux, darwin, windows and INTERSECT: a function is "dead" only if
#     dead in EVERY config.
#     Q5 record (re-verified 2026-08-16 at implementation): windows-gated
#     non-test code EXISTS under internal/ (internal/hooks/procgroup_windows.go
#     per commit 85851434, plus internal/{robot,tmux,alerts,history,session,
#     config,supervisor,pipeline,cli,assignment}/*_windows.go) => three runs.
#     GOARCH is pinned to amd64 for determinism across dev/CI hosts; no
#     GOARCH-gated first-party file exists under internal/ or cmd/ (verified
#     by filename and //go:build grep at implementation time).
#   - Orphan-package check: deadcode only sees packages reachable in the
#     import graph, so a NEVER-imported package (C9's nine) produces zero
#     entries. `go list ./internal/...` minus `go list -deps ./cmd/ntm` fills
#     that blind spot; those violations use entry form `pkg:internal/<path>`.
#   - Reflection-only check: deadcode keeps every exported method of a type
#     that reaches an interface value (RTA's reflection rule), so an uncalled
#     method on a live type is never reported. scripts/guards/reflectdead
#     lists functions RTA reaches that no call path from main reaches, per
#     GOOS, intersected like deadcode, in the same <file>.go:<Func> form
#     (bd-8gbr3). Canary cases d/e pin its behavior.
#
# Entry format in ci/allowlists/deadcode.txt:
#   <file>.go:<Func>        e.g. internal/coordinator/conflicts.go:Engine.Run
#   pkg:internal/<path>     an entire internal package unreachable from cmd/ntm
#
# Known blind spots + compensations:
#   - reflect.Value.Call targets can be falsely dead => `# permanent:
#     reflection` allowlist section, reason names the reaching call site.
#     Cobra RunE indirection is NOT such a case: RTA tracks address-taken
#     dynamically-invoked funcs — proven by the canary before every run.
#   - Test helpers in non-test files are reported dead (no -test): either move
#     them into _test.go files or add a `# permanent: test-helper` entry
#     naming the reaching test.
#   - WS0-G2 claims (config.RegisterReader(key, fn)) take fn as a value, which
#     keeps a reader nothing else calls reachable. Every claim lives in a
#     liveness_claims*.go file constrained `//go:build !liveness_audit`, and
#     the analysis builds with -tags liveness_audit, so a function alive only
#     through its claim is reported dead (bd-ir0li). The placement check
#     keeps that exclusion complete: a claim in any other file, or a claim
#     file without the constraint, fails the gate.
#   - Generated files: excluded by deadcode's generated-file handling.
#
# Mandatory canary (scripts/guards/testdata/deadcode_canary/, standalone
# module): (a) OrphanExported must be reported dead, (b) cobra-RunE-only
# runEDispatch must NOT be, (c) tested-but-unwired TestedButUnwired must be.
# Any miss aborts the gate — a guard that cannot demonstrate a catch is a
# placebo with a green badge.
#
# Toolchain wiring: the bare-ubuntu `reality-guards` CI job has no Go; there
# this script validates allowlist entry shape only and exits 0. The full
# analysis is guaranteed in CI by the dedicated `reality-guards-go` job
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml), which sets up Go and runs this script.
